#WikiMarkit
API project for Thinkful  - an app that searches Wikipedia and provides public equity details and charts via Markit on Demand.

##Introduction
WikiMarkit is an investor's informational treasure trove. It allows the user to search Wikipedia which can provide valuable fundamental insight into a company as well as its history and general stock performance. Markit on Demand, meanwhile, provides the user with up-to-the-hour stock information such as price and change. The user is also provided with an interactive stock chart that can be beneficial to technical traders.
Please note, Markit's search only accepts stock symbols - notable ones include FB (Facebook), NKE (Nike), MSFT (Microsoft), AAPL (Apple), and GOOG (Alphabet Inc)       

##Use Case
Why use this app? A typical investor is either fundamentally-motivated or trades according to charts ie technical analysis. By providing charts as well as access to historical information, WikiMarkit combines features for both types of investors and can be used as a way for them to conduct their base-level due diligence as to whether a certain stock piques their interest or not.   

##UX
The app is divided into 2 columns. The left one searches Wikipedia while the one on the right provides the stock data and chart.  

##To use
gh-pages is not a fan of getting info over http which is how MoD's charts work.
